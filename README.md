## Workflow

[PhotoFilmStrip](https://www.photofilmstrip.org/en/features/) has a great simple UI to make slideshows. I use it to make videos of my travels.  
First I choose a song as a background. That defines the duration of the video.  
Then I add around 40 images. PhotoFilmStrip adds some random animations to every image. That's ok.  
The duration of the image is automatically calculated to fill the song duration. Great.  
I then add subtitles to every image. Eventually, I can modify the animation and change the order of the images.  
The UI is so easy, that even my wife likes to use it.  
Finally, PhotoFilmStrip renders the slideshow as a mp4 file and the subtitles as a srt file. That is fine, but...

I prefer to have the subtitles embedded in the video, so every video player will show them exactly how I want it. I encountered a lot of odd problems with separated `srt` files in different video players online and offline.  
I use `ffmpeg` in Debian to do that.

```bash
ffmpeg -i "MexicoCity.mkv" -vf subtitles="MexicoCity.srt:force_style='FontSize=32'" "MexicoCity_srt.mp4"
```

To install `ffmpeg`:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
